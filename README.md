# Interactive_Job_and_Internship_Platform_project
A responsive and user-friendly web application designed to help users find jobs and internships based on personalized filters. this project reflects my interest in building real-time, user-centric web applications and my ongoing journey in full-stack development.

This project is a responsive job and internship platform built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. It allows users to search opportunities using personalized filters. We added features like a chatbot for user queries and an ATS-based resume review system.

We built this responsive job and internship platform using the MERN-like stack with the following tools and technologies:

Frontend:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to create a clean, responsive, and interactive user interface.

Backend:
Node.js and Express.js powered the server-side logic, enabling efficient handling of user requests and data flow.

Database:
MySQL was used to store user data, job listings, and application records, with structured schema and real-time data retrieval.

Additional Features:
1. Integrated a chatbot for answering common queries.
2. Implemented an ATS scoreâ€“based resume feedback system using logic to match keywords and structure.
